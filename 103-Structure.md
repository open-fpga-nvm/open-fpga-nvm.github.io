#Scheme

**FPGA Based NVM Controller**

The main object of this project is to design a NVM-controller for Emerging NVM, such as: MRAM, Nand-Flash, PCM; that can extract all the characteristics of NVM those determine their performance and quality, and then provide a user-friendly-testablle platform. The whole scheme is developed mainly by designing one universal NVM controller by configuring same FPGA which serve this purpose. Please go thorough next link for detail visualization of this FPGA based memory controller design.

**NVM Daughter Board in PCB**

Custom Printed Circuit Daughter Boards for proper connection with memory controller have been made for each of NVM type. You may Go thorough next link if you have interest in PCB design or required for your own PCB design.
