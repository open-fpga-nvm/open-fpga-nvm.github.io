Open FPGA NVM is open sourced characterization platform for evaluating real NVM devices(e.g. MRAM, PCM, RRAM, TLC/MLC/SLC NAND flashs, etc.).

This project includes:

- Verilog code for FPGA device
- Python code for controller host PC
- Hardware design and schemetics for physically connecting NVM chips to FPGA board.


Contribution is always welcomed.

Thanks !
