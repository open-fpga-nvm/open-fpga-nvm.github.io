From skeptical point of view, about this wiki, this legit disclamation is saying, _"Here we have shared information derived from our own pragmatistic experience. All the possible facet may not be included as we are on our learning curve as well. This is not a good dogmatic resource as well for learning all about FPGA or PCB design. We project our emphasis on finding Non-Volatile-Memory performance in application and system architecture. Still for newbie, this will guide to a smooth learning curve in starting your project on FPGA, PCB or SoC. From All the resources we took help or found to be helpful are included as well."_
